# Cod-Camo-Progress-Tracker
This Project was completed in CS 1181: Computer Science II at Wright State University.

This project tracks the progress on completing in game challenges in the 2019 Call of Duty Modern Warfare game.

It contains a command line interface that prompts the user on how many kills they got in a recent Call of duty game.
It then randomly assigns a camo challenge to be completed by every kill.
There are menu options to update progress, see progress, delete progress, reset all stats, inquire about needed challenges, or quit.
The program can also save the data to a binary file so that when started, it can load progress from previous games.
